'''RULES
This is a computerized version of a game called 'Guns' or 'Slap-Slap-Draw' in middle school. Two players face each other 
and slap their legs rhythmically and simultaneously, to a beat of slap-slap-move.
When you move, you can either fire, reload, or block. The goal is to fire, with at least one bullet on hand, while your 
opponent reloads. If both players fire at once, and both have bullets, the game just continues. No one dies.'''
